## Cost Tracker
**Track your spendings using receipt snapshots.
Watch and be wary of your spending habits.
Save money. Spend smarter.**

Cost Tracker is the part of Cost that actually tracks users' individual spendings.
It stores data from single purchases (single receipts).
The tracker helps you think about the way you spend, by showing you relevant data trends and spending habits the user might have.


### Storing purchase data

A snapshot of a receipt goes through an AI for image-to-text.
The file is saved automatically the way it was interpreted, but the user has the option to edit it.
The file itself is analyzed by two types of products - unit- and weight-based.

**The relevant data is:**
1. Date and Time.
2. Location.
3. Product name.
4. Product price (based on type - units or weight).

**Products are created and assigned:**
1. Date and Time of purchase.
2. Store of purchase.
3. Name.
4. Sum of purchase.
5. Purchase per unit / per 100 g.


### Tracking and concluding

The user will be able to see expenses over time, with filtering options: by specific store, category or product.
The next level is an AI analysis of main spending trends, or just general stats popping up.
(TODO - In what other way is tracking your spendings smart? How can we help with that?)
