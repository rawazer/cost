## Cost Map
**Join a community of shoppers, uncovering free information and pushing for the lowest price!**
Cost Map is the part of Cost that covers the collective information-sharing potential which the personal spending tracker holds.
It displays the data upon a map GUI, with options of travelling and finding prices of a specific store, of lowest price in a range, or for planning shopping by specific shopping list.
Going to be developed much later on...

**Ideas for now:**
1. Insert specific product and list.
2. Manually update prices (without buying, "just saw").
3. Timeline of product price in specific store.
4. Timeline of min and average price of product by area (increase-decrease scope).
(for last two points, toggle between my purchases and community's)
